# Zelcash Builder for Apple Platform

![Screenshot](https://github.com/Lumiboy/zelcash-mac/raw/master/docs/zelcash-apple.png "Zelcash on Mac OS")

This repository builds standalone Zelcash binaries for macOS platform without installing brew.  
No additional dependency required except Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode).  
All build tools (`autoconf, automake, libtool, pkgconfig, cmake, install and readlink`) and `Zelcash` are compiled from scratch (finally with `clang`).  

###  OSX - macOS.

Min. OSX version: 10.8.x  
Tested on 10.12.x :white_check_mark:  
Tested on 10.13.x :white_check_mark:  


### Build instructions
```shell
# run once to install Xcode CLI tools
$ xcode-select --install
# clone and build Zelcash on macOS
$ git clone https://github.com/Lumiboy/zelcash-mac.git
$ cd zelcash-mac
$ source environment
$ make
```

In case of an error please run the following command for debug info
```shell
$ PRINT_DEBUG=y make all
```

After successful build Zelcash binaries will be installed to `out` directory under project root  
You can then copy binary directory anywhere you like there are no dependencies to the build tree anymore  
```shell
bash-3.2$ ls -lrt out/usr/local/bin

```

### Run instructions

When launching `Zelcash` on MacOS for the first time, certain initalization steps should be completed.  
Please run the commands below once for the first time  

```shell
$ cd out/usr/local/bin
$ ./zcash-fetch-params
$ ./zelcash-init
$ ./zelcashd
```

You can just run `Zelcash` by launching the daemon afterwards  

`$ ./zelcashd`  

Console output from the first run is below:
```shell
bash-3.2$ ./zcash-fetch-params
Zelcash - fetch-params.sh

This script will fetch the Zelcash zkSNARK parameters and verify their
integrity with sha256sum.

If they already exist locally, it will exit now and do nothing else.
The parameters are currently just under 911MB in size, so plan accordingly
for your bandwidth constraints. If the files are already present and
have the correct sha256sum, no networking is used.

Creating params directory. For details about this directory, see:
